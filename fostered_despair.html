Man, I’m stuck with the dishes again. Why do I have to do all the chores around here? It wasn’t even my choice to live here! And besides, the Fletchers have like twelve other kids, why do they never have to do any chores? Oh, my stomach is rumbling again, geez I’m so hungry. I looked away for one second and one of those little brats snatched my dinner. And the worst part? The Fletchers don’t even care! They just brushed me off and told me to deal with it on my own. But of course, when I stand up for myself, here come the fletchers! Here to save the day! Just yesterday, Brentley tried pushing me down the steps as some kind of sick joke, so naturally I hit him back. I mean, what else did he expect? He always pulls stunts like this, and it’s about time he learned his lesson. Well, Mr. Fletcher scolded me, and I had to spend the night in the closet. It’s so unfair! I wish I could go home. Away from all of this. I don’t understand why I have to be here in the first place. It’s not like things are better now than before. I wonder how mom’s doing. The lady at the office promised me I would hear from her soon, but it’s been months, and still nothing. Come to think of it, how long has it even been? I’ve lost track of the days at this point. The trees have begun to shed their leaves, and it’s getting real cold outside, so it must be about fall now, maybe September or October. Wow, that means the new school year has already started... And as much as I hate school, it’s not even my choice to miss it! It’s way too far to walk from here, but the Fletchers don’t seem to care, so I’ve just been stuck at home all day (calling this place home even feels wrong). My grades were already in the gutter before, I don’t even want to imagine what they’ll look like after missing MONTHS of school. Ugh. Everything feels hopeless. How did things end up this way? At this point, it’s bound to get better from here...
