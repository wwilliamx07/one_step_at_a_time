        <h2><i>One Step At A Time</i></h2>
        <p>
            My multi-text explores the realities of socioeconomic inequality from the perspective of Max, a young boy living with his mother in a low socioeconomic status (SES) household. Through Max’s story, readers get a shocking, yet grounded, and realistic glimpse into this issue.

            The texts are contained within a site that presents itself as a social services organization. On the outside, the site is plastered with images of happy children, inspiring stories, and slogans like “We can help!”. However, upon logging in, Max’s files will be shown, along with the case files of many other children. My goal is to design this site to be as realistic as possible, leaving readers with the impression that the website belongs to an actual organization, bringing realism and credibility to Max’s story. Additionally, once readers begin to understand Max’s story and how he was failed by social services, the juxtaposition between the front page of the website and the dark realities it holds within will reflect the way that socioeconomic inequality is hard to grasp from an outsider perspective.
            
            The first entry is Max’s childhood diary, which serves as an exposition to Max’s personality, living situation, and family. At school, Max feels different from his peers due to his lack of nice clothes and toys. However, he does not complain, because he knows how hard his mother works to put clothes on his back and food on the table. At home, Max finds his mother sleeping on the couch as she usually does at this time, however, he is too young to understand that this is a result of his mother’s addiction to alcohol. Despite Max’s financial and familial struggles, he demonstrates optimism and resilience. He cares deeply for his mother, who works hard to provide for herself and Max, despite her struggles with addiction. In addition to serving as an exposition, this piece is intended to provide a look into what low SES can entail. It is not synonymous with poverty or low income, but is rather a combination of factors such as income, family situation, and education.
            
            The second and third pieces delve into Max’s experience with social services and the foster home system, demonstrating the unfortunate realities of these systems, and how they often lack meaningful and effective solutions for people in need. Max is removed from his mother as a result of her addiction, and is thrown into a foster home, where he is abused and neglected. Though Max does not understand why he and his mother were separated, he still tries to keep an optimistic outlook on life. Slowly, Max’s new reality whittles down his innocence and optimism, eventually driving him to run away from his foster home to escape his endured abuse and the poor living conditions. These pieces are intended to emphasize the multifaceted nature of low SES. One struggle leads to another because Max does not have the necessary resources to break free from this cycle. Low SES is a seemingly inescapable reality for Max that pervades into every aspect of his life, as is the case with many people who struggle with low SES in our society.
            
            20 years after running away from his foster home, Max writes a letter to his mother, who is currently being held in a mental institution. Max delves into the details of the years following their separation, in which he experiences homelessness and difficulty finding work due to his low level of education. Max works hard, doing odd jobs until he is able to rent an apartment and land a job. Towards the tail end of the 20 year period, Max has gotten married, and has his own child on the way. Despite struggling with the trauma he experienced early in life, he sees his unborn child as his hope for a better future, and dedicates himself to protecting his son’s right to a childhood and loving family. This piece demonstrates the deep, multi-generational challenges that can come with low SES, as well as connects the entire multi-text back to my chosen noun “step”. Max represents another step towards a better life for future generations of his family.
            
            The noun step symbolizes the slow and gradual process of breaking free from the various factors that encompass low SES. One step could mean getting a higher paying job, another step could be achieving a higher level of education. Each step contributes towards the objective of escaping low SES. However, it is often unclear how many steps are actually ahead. It could be a hundred, perhaps a thousand, or more. Additionally, a step could be forwards or backwards, and vary in size. Those who are less privileged may need to take a much greater number of steps compared to those who are more privileged in order to attain the same level of achievement, demonstrating the complexity of making progress towards escaping low SES. Through my noun, and my character Max, I hope to illustrate the systemic nature of low SES, and how it affects every facet of life, potentially holding lifelong or even generational consequences.
